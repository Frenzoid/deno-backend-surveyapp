# Still on work!!
## READ CAREFULLY:
Im going to refrain from developing this backend until Deno and deno packages get fully developed, since on each Deno update a lot of major stuff changes and breaks the project, and since the deno packages aren't fully developed, the only way to use the newer features are updating to the latest Deno version, so until those packages i use get 100% finished, i'll stop developing this backend.

#### This backend contains:
- OAK
- JWT
- CRUD
- DenoDB
- bcrypt
- dotenv
